\title{Relative Entropy spread.}
\usage{
TWCR.relative.entropy.spread(old.mean, old.sd, new.mean, new.sd, new.n = 56,
  perturbed.mean = NULL, perturbed.sd = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{old.mean}{Field of best estimates from climatology}

\item{old.sd}{Field of climatological standard deviations}

\item{new.mean}{Field of best estimates from TWCR}

\item{new.sd}{Field of standard deviations from TWCR}

\item{new.n}{number of ensembles making up TWCR (default=56).}
}
\value{
list with components upper (field of RE+n*sigma) and
  lower (field of RE-n*sigma).
}
\description{
We only estimate the relative entropy, because we only have
estimates of the means and standard deviations. This
function estimates the spread of the relative entropy.
}
\details{
Calculating a standard error for RE is hard, and it's an asymetric
 distribution so an exact sigma is of limited use anyway. This function
 estimates the value by perturbing the input means and standard
 deviations and combining the results in quadrature.
