\title{TWCR get data directory}
\usage{
TWCR.get.data.dir(version = "3.5.1")
}
\value{
Base directory name (or NULL is no local files)
}
\description{
Find local data directory - different for different systems
}
\details{
It's much faster to read data from local disc than over openDAP,
 also observations and standard deviations are currently only
 available locally. But the various different systems on which I run this code all have
 different places to keep large data files. This function returns
 the right base directory for the system (if there is one).
