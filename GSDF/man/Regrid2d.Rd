\title{Regrid a 2d field to match another 2d field}
\usage{
Regrid2d(g, g.grid, full = NULL, greedy = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{g}{2d GSDF field}

\item{g.grid}{2d GSDF field with same set of dimensions}

\item{full}{- TRUE => apply appropriate boundary conditions for full
global lat:lon field (wrap longitudes and extrapolate near poles if required,
FALSE => just interpolate (removes data outside range of g.grid),
NULL (default) => Guess which to do (is field ll and covering most of globe?).}

\item{greedy}{boolean. If FALSE (default) NA values in the input field
propagate to generate NA values in all output values adjacent to them.
If true, output values are NA only if all adjacent grid points are NA.}
}
\value{
GSDF field with data from g on grid of g.grid
}
\description{
Makes the first field  have the same grid as the second
}
\details{
Both fields must have exactly 2 extended dimensions, and those dimensions
must have the same labels (e.g. both lat,long, or both lat,height).
}
