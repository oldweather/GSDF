\title{Apply boundary conditions to a field for interpolation}
\usage{
Regrid2dBoundaryConditions(old, new, type)
}
\arguments{
\item{old}{- 'from' points in 1-dimension}

\item{new}{- 'to' points}

\item{type}{- 'lat', 'lon' or other, apply periodic bc if 'lon'}
}
\value{
revised 'new' points
}
\description{
Makes regrid.2d work correctly for globaly complete fields
}
\details{
When the 'to' grid has higher resolution than the 'from'
grid, some 'from' points will be outside the span of the 'to'
points. Tweak the 'to' points to put them inside - effectively
this does constant extrapolation outside the bounds.
Also fixes the -180-180 or 0-360 inconsistency in longitude
 if 'old' and 'new' are different in this respect.
