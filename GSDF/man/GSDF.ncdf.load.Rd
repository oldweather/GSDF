\title{Load a GSDF field from a netCDF file or URL}
\usage{
GSDF.ncdf.load(file, variable, lat.range = NULL, lon.range = NULL,
  height.range = NULL, time.range = NULL, ens.range = NULL,
  custom.range = NULL, default.calendar = "gregorian", lat.name = NULL,
  lon.name = NULL, height.name = NULL, time.name = NULL,
  ens.name = NULL, use.cache = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{Text name of file or URI.}

\item{variable}{Text name of variable (in file).}

\item{lat.range}{Two-element vector with max and min latitudes to retrieve.
Leave NULL only if variable has no latitude dimension.}

\item{lon.range}{Two-element vector with max and min longitudes to retrieve.
Leave NULL only if variable has no longitude dimension.}

\item{height.range}{Two-element vector with max and min heights to retrieve.
Leave NULL only if variable has no height dimension.}

\item{time.range}{Two-element vector of chron with max and min times to retrieve.
Leave NULL only if variable has no time dimension.}

\item{ens.range}{Two-element vector with max and min ensemble members to retrieve.
Leave NULL only if variable has no ensemble dimension.}

\item{default.calendar}{What calendar does file use (if not specified in file)? 
Supported values are 'gregorian', 'proleptic_gregorian', '365_day', and '360_day'.}

\item{lat.name}{Text name used by file as label of latitude variable. If NULL, will
try to guess it.}

\item{lon.name}{Text name used by file as label of longitude variable. If NULL, will
try to guess it.}

\item{height.name}{Text name used by file as label of height variable. If NULL, will
try to guess it.}

\item{time.name}{Text name used by file as label of time variable. If NULL, will
try to guess it.}

\item{ens.name}{Text name used by file as label of ensemble number variable. If NULL, will
try to guess it.}

\item{use.cache}{Unless FALSE, use a cached version of the data if available (requires
GSDF.cache.dir set and the exact data available in that directory).}
}
\value{
GSDF field with selected subset of file data.
}
\description{
Loads a specified hyperslab (range of lat, lon, height and time)
 from a NetCDF file (or an openDAP server)
}
\details{
This works only for some netCDF files (netCDF is a very flexible file 
 format and it's necessary to make assumptions about how the data is stored);
 Does work on most CMIP5 data and reanalyses.
Original version with chron dates.
