\title{Regrid a 2d field to match another 2d field}
\usage{
GSDF.regrid.2d(g, g.grid, full = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{g}{2d GSDF field}

\item{g.grid}{2d GSDF field with same set of dimensions}

\item{full}{- TRUE => apply appropriate boundary conditions for full
global lat:lon field (wrap longitudes and extrapolate near poles if required,
FALSE => just interpolate (removes data outside range of g.grid),
NULL (default) => Guess which to do (is field ll and covering most of globe?).}
}
\value{
GSDF field with data from g on grid of g.grid
}
\description{
Makes the first field  have the same grid as the second
}
\details{
Both fields must have exactly 2 extended dimensions, and those dimensions
must have the same labels (e.g. both lat,long, or both lat,height).
}
