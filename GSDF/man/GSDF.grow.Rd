grown field.
}
\description{
Given a spatially incomplete GSDF field, extrapolate the field into
 missing regions by adding one grid point round the boundary of all
 non-missing sections.
}
\details{
Mostly useful for sea-ice - because rotating and regridding only interpolates,
 grid-boxes which are adjacent to missing data are removed by either process.
This is a hack - but it mostly repairs the damage.
