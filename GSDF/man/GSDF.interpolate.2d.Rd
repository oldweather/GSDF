\title{Interpolate points in a 2d field}
\usage{
GSDF.interpolate.2d(g, x, y)
}
\arguments{
\item{g}{GSDF data structure}

\item{x}{values to interpolate to in 1st dimension}

\item{y}{values to interpolate to in 2nd dimension}
}
\value{
numeric vector of interpolated values
}
\description{
2d bilinear interpolation (uses fields package)
}
\details{
Interpolate values at a set of x,y points in a
2d field. Note that x is the first dimension in the field
and y the second dimension whatever the names of those dimensions.
The field must have exactly 2 extended dimensions.
