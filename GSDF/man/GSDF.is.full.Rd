\title{GSDF is full field}
\usage{
GSDF.is.full(g.grid)
}
\arguments{
\item{g.grid}{Field to test}
}
\value{
logical: TRUE if full, FALSE otherwise
}
\description{
Is field lat:lon and global in scope?
}
\details{
Interpolation can shrink a field round the edges,
this is not OK for global fields - we want to preserve global coverage
so identify those and treat then specially.
Also this deals with wrap-arounds in longitude (0:360 v -180:180).
